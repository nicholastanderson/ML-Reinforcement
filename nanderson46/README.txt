Original java code from: https://github.com/juanjose49/omscs-cs7641-machine-learning-assignment-4

I have only made slight changes to the original code (from the url above) to output data to .csv's for visualization purposes

Files included: 
/src/
/data/
DataMerge.R


Instructions for running code: 
- Open workspace in IntelliJ and make sure that the src folder is in your working directory
- Open the following files: 
	C:\bench\ML-Reinforcement\src\burlap\assignment4\EasyGridWorldLauncher <- Small state
	C:\bench\ML-Reinforcement\src\burlap\assignment4\HardGridWorldLauncher <- Large state
- Click run for each file (ensure output directory exists)


To create visualizations: 
- Open DataMerge.R and run the file to combine small and large state results
- Open Tableau dashboard (/data/visualizations.twbx)
